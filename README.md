# Megha Verma

Backend & Distributed Systems Engineer  
Streaming Platforms • High-Scale Services • Java • AWS

I work on backend systems where **scale, latency, correctness, and reliability are non-negotiable**.

---

## One Thing That Defines My Work
Built a **stitching service** that serves **millions of streaming sessions every day**,  
operating under tight latency budgets and high availability requirements.

---

## How I Approach Engineering
- Start with the simplest thing that can work
- Design for failure before success
- Make trade-offs explicit and revisitable
- Prefer systems that are easy to reason about at 3 a.m.
- Treat observability as part of the design, not an afterthought

---

## Areas I Work In
**Backend & Concurrency** — Java, Akka, REST, SQL  
**Streaming & Media Systems** — DASH, HLS, SSAI, FFmpeg, SCTE-35  
**Distributed Data & Messaging** — Kafka, Redis  
**Cloud & Infrastructure** — AWS, Terraform  
**Observability** — Metrics, logs, tracing, dashboards

---

## Experience
Warner Bros Discovery • Amdocs  
Building and operating systems at real-world scale.

---

## What You’ll Find on My GitHub
- System design notes and architectural reasoning
- Backend experiments focused on correctness and performance
- Refactoring-heavy repositories that show how systems evolve
- Learning in public, without polishing for show

I value **depth over breadth** and **clarity over cleverness**.
