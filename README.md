# Megha Verma

Backend & Distributed Systems Engineer  
Streaming Platforms • Scalable Services • Java • AWS

I work on backend systems where **scale, latency, and reliability matter**.

---

## Project Highlight
Built/Improve a **stitching** powering **millions of daily streaming sessions**,  
designed for high availability, low latency, and safe evolution.

---

## Engineering Mindset
- Prefer simple, predictable systems over clever abstractions
- Design assuming things will fail
- Optimize only after measuring
- Treat observability as a first-class feature
- Think in trade-offs, not tools

---

**Backend & Concurrency:** Java, Akka, REST, SQL  
**Streaming & Media:** DASH, HLS, SSAI, FFmpeg, SCTE-35  
**Cloud & Infrastructure:** AWS, Terraform

## On GitHub
You’ll find:
- System design notes and trade-off discussions
- Backend experiments and refactoring work
- Learning-driven repositories over polished demos

I optimize for **understanding**, not presentation.
